# datafun-07-ml
## Purpose
This purpose of this project is to introduce Machine Learning. This will be done using guided projects all listed in this project.

- Note: all commands are using macOS if using project as a guide with windows note that execution commands may be different

## Project initialization
1. Create new project in github named datafun-07-ml
2. Pull project to local machine

git clone https://github.com/s256657/datafun-07-ml
cd datafun-07-ml
code .
```
3. Added .gitignore and requirements.txt folders
4. created and activate virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
5. Installed dependencies
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Add data folder
- named "ave_hi_nyc_jan_1985-2018.csv
7. Create Jupyter folder
- named craigwilcox_ml.ipynb
